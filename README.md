Darwin: A Framework for Machine Learning Research and Development
====

This is the main software repository for the Darwin machine learning
library. You probably want to get the latest version (master) or one
of the stable releases (release/x.y). To do this use one of the
following:

    git clone https://github.com/sgould/drwn.git darwin
    git clone git@github.com:sgould/drwn.git darwin
    svn co https://github.com/sgould/drwn darwin

Previously the Darwin software was stored in an Subversion repository
at https://svn.anu.edu.au/AI/drwn. You can check out earlier versions
(e.g., version 1.7) with:

    svn co https://svn.anu.edu.au/AI/drwn/release/1.7 darwin
