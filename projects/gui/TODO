* DARWIN GUI/OTHER

1. command line tools: databaseUtility (check, list, compress), evaluateGraph, ...
2. client/server model; capability communication (plugins and versions)
3. separate loading of gradient from data
4. regression tests
5. plugin architecture (dynamic libraries; registration) -- see http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LibraryArchives-StaticAndDynamic.html
6. last modified for tables and databases
7. XML-ify the database files
8. dataPort links (ghost ports)
9. hierarchical groups in the node registry
10. node descriptions in the node registry
11. rework dataCache to work from table
12. incorporate global objective in local re-estimation methods
13. add most-recently used files (wxFileHistory)
14. more efficient gui drawing when dragging, etc.
15. check whether ports on the same node connect to the same source (can't lock when processing)
16. graph dirty flag (check when closing/clearing)
17. drwnStandardAdaptiveNode modeled off multi-class logistic
18. scripting language (lua?)
19. change evaluateForwards to always call updateForwards
20. refactor the database classes
21. Win32 matlab project
22. fixed size vector and matrix options
23. implement utility nodes subGraphNode and cloneNode (nodes in subGraph do not store records --- use for zero-memory operations)
24. vacinity interface for port connectivity in GUI;
25. examples
26. documentation; cheatsheet
27. add mask input to drwnBinaryOpNode
28. bug: options in drwnOptionsEditor don't get set if Ok is clicked before navigating away from cell (on linux)
29. add updatePorts() method to drwnMultiIONode (and call from read method -- see Matlab node); option to make num. input/output ports fixed (read-only)
30. add norm methods to drwnBinaryOpNode
31. verify GUI follows http://docs.wxwidgets.org/stable/wx_allocatingobjects.html#allocatingobjects
32. enumerate datatypes (numerical, ordinal, categorical) and data structures (independent/sequence, chain, tree, grid/image, graph, hypergraph)
33. html report output
34. code export (with commandline options)
35. record datatypes; input port accept types list and output port emits type
36. templated (int, double) adaptive node base class (derived from multiIO node) (or classifier node vs. regression node)
37. drwnAdaptiveOptimizationNode class (derived from drwnOptimizer and drwnAdaptiveNode)
38. text mode for matrix/vector editor
39. plugin registration for editors (e.g. Matlab matrix editor)
40. bug: (non-binary) boosting performance can deteriorate with additional rounds (on training set)
41. hierarchical properties (property can be a list of properties); displays as [+] in GUI
42. output-only version of drwnGUIShellWindow
43. drwnGUIImageViewerWindow for OpenCV nodes; allow multiple images at once; advance through images, etc.
44. undo/redo feature in GUI; apply diff to XML serialization to reduce footprint (?)
45. tidy up darwin.cpp application
46. clean up drwnCompressionBuffer interface; compress database on table by table basis
47. source nodes don't need to store data in database (can just re-read from source (?))
48. why is drwnDatabase so slow when cache is full?
49. split progress monitoring functionality from drwnLogger and make thread safe; check abort works when multiple loops
50. change drwnDataRecord member access to indicate const/non-const modes
51. python plugin (cf. Matlab)
52. run drwnCacheManager in a separate thread; make library thread safe; pre-fetch records
53. colour input to point cloud viewer
54. bug: copying a node should not rename previous node's database table (on disk)
55. allow confusion matrix to be constructed with weighted examples
56. classifiers resume training is not initialized when train method is called
57. read http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/~kettner/courses/lib_design_03/notes/advanced.html
58. do away with drwnOptions class altogether; have writeOption, readOption utilities and getProperties member function; but will still need validator, so probably worth sticking with options
59. add displayName in addition to className in factory registration
60. lua plugin node (show version number in properties)
61. separate in-memory records from persistent ones (faster pack() function)
62. use hash_set (non-standard) instead of set in drwnDataTable
63. update to OpenCV 2.2 and c++ interface
64. change to Qt and use CMake
