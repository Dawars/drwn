ROSETTA PROJECT README

This project demonstrates the inference algorithms available in the
Darwin framework by testing them on the Rosetta Protein Design
problems (Yanover et al., JMLR 2006).

* DOWNLOADING THE DATA

The dataset can be downloaded using the getRosettaData.sh
script. Alternatively, you can fetch it manually from

http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume7/yanover06a/Rosetta_Design_Dataset.tgz

Warning: it is 2.5GB.

* CONVERTING FORMATS

The data is in Matlab format. The script rosetta2drwn.m converts it to
an XML format that Darwin can recognize. The script
convertRosettaData.sh will automatically convert all the design files
and then compress them to save space. You must have Matlab or Octave
installed to perform this step.

You may need to install Chen Yanover's sparse cell class to read the
data. It can be downloaded from:

http://cyanover.fhcrc.org/sparse_cell_2.tgz

* RUNNING INFERENCE

The runRosettaExperiments.sh script runs different inference
algorithms. Calling the script with no arguments will run inference on
each of the design files (and creates a separate log for each
one). Alternatively, you can call the script with the basename of the
design file that you want to run inference on, e.g.,

./runRosettaExperiments.sh 1bx7

Warning: some inference routines take a very long time to complete.
